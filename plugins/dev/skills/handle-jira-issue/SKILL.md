description: Handle any Jira issue end-to-end — an ITSM ticket or a project issue (BAC/WEB/FA). Fetch details (from the linked ITSM ticket when one exists), link or create a project issue only when needed, branch, fix, test, review, and open a PR. Use whenever the user links to or names a Jira issue to fix.

# Handle Jira Issue Workflow

Triggered when the user says something like "fix this issue" and provides any Jira issue key or link — either an ITSM ticket (e.g. `ITSM-1234`) or a project issue (e.g. `BAC-6934`, `WEB-1234`, `FA-987`), or a full Jira URL (e.g. `https://hoopit.atlassian.net/browse/ITSM-1234`).

## Configuration — read from CLAUDE.md, never hardcode

This skill is project-agnostic. Every Hoopit-specific identifier (Jira keys, the
Jira base URL, the ITSM project key, repo names) comes from the
**`## Agent skills` → `### Workflow skills config`** block in each repo's
`CLAUDE.md`. **Do not hardcode or guess these** — read them from CLAUDE.md. If a
value you need is missing from the relevant repo's CLAUDE.md, **stop and ask the
user to add it** rather than assuming a default.

The repos are sibling directories under a common parent (`HOOPIT_ROOT`); derive
it from the repo this skill is invoked in:

```bash
HOOPIT_ROOT="$(dirname "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")"
```

### Build the Jira-key → repo map dynamically

Do **not** assume a fixed `BAC/WEB/FA` map. For each sibling repo under
`$HOOPIT_ROOT` that has a `CLAUDE.md`, read its declared **Jira project key** from
the Workflow skills config block. That yields the current `Jira key → repo`
mapping, so new projects work without editing this skill:

```bash
# Prints "KEY<TAB>/path/to/repo" for every sibling repo that declares a Jira key.
for repo in "$HOOPIT_ROOT"/*/; do
  cm="$repo/CLAUDE.md"; [ -f "$cm" ] || continue
  key="$(grep -iE '^\s*[-*]\s*\*\*Jira project key:\*\*' "$cm" | grep -oE '`[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+`' | tr -d '`' | head -1)"
  [ -n "$key" ] && printf '%s\t%s\n' "$key" "${repo%/}"
done
```

(At the time of writing that resolves to `BAC → api`, `WEB → web-admin`,
`FA → flutter-app`, but always resolve it from CLAUDE.md.)

Once you know `TARGET_REPO`, read the rest of its Workflow skills config —
**Jira base URL**, **ITSM project key**, **Default branch** — from that repo's
CLAUDE.md and use them in place of the literals below.

Variables used throughout this skill:
- `TARGET_PROJECT` — the Jira project key the fix is tracked under.
- `TARGET_REPO` — the repo whose CLAUDE.md declares `TARGET_PROJECT`.
- `TARGET_KEY` — the project issue key in `TARGET_PROJECT` (e.g. `BAC-6934`). Becomes the working `JIRA_KEY`.
- `JIRA_BASE_URL` — the Jira base URL from `TARGET_REPO`'s CLAUDE.md (e.g. `https://hoopit.atlassian.net`).
- `ITSM_PROJECT` — the ITSM project key from CLAUDE.md (e.g. `ITSM`); ITSM keys look like `<ITSM_PROJECT>-1234`.
- `DEFAULT_BRANCH` — `TARGET_REPO`'s default branch from CLAUDE.md (e.g. `master`).
- `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY` — the linked ITSM ticket, **if one exists**. May be unset.
- `DETAILS_KEY` — the issue you read the bug report / symptoms / attachments from: the **ITSM ticket when one exists**, otherwise the project issue itself.

> Wherever the steps below show `https://hoopit.atlassian.net`, `ITSM`, or
> `master`, substitute `$JIRA_BASE_URL`, `$ITSM_PROJECT`, and `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`
> from CLAUDE.md.

> **PR/Jira link hygiene:** when naming the branch (Step 3), writing commit
> messages (Steps 6–7), or authoring the PR (Step 9), load the
> `create-pull-request` skill and follow it. For this workflow the work items the
> PR may link are `JIRA_KEY` and — only when an ITSM ticket is linked —
> `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY`; keep every other Jira key out of those surfaces.

## Determine the scenario

Before anything else, classify the input issue. If a full Jira URL was provided, extract the issue key from it first, then look at the key's prefix:

### Input is an ITSM ticket (`ITSM-…`) — *ITSM-originated*

- `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY` = the input key.
- `DETAILS_KEY` = `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY`.
- `TARGET_PROJECT` / `TARGET_KEY` are resolved in **Step 2** (an existing linked project issue, or a new one you create).

### Input is a project issue (`BAC-…`, `WEB-…`, `FA-…`) — *project-originated*

- `TARGET_KEY` = the input key; `TARGET_PROJECT` = its prefix; `TARGET_REPO` = the matching repo. **No new project issue will ever be created** — the input issue *is* the target.
- Check whether it links to an ITSM ticket by fetching the `issuelinks` field (see the parsing note in Step 2a — inspect both `inwardIssue.key` and `outwardIssue.key`):

  ```bash
  acli jira workitem view <TARGET_KEY> --fields 'issuelinks' --json
  ```

  - **Linked `ITSM-…` issue found** → set `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY` to it; `DETAILS_KEY` = `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY`. (Read details from the ITSM ticket, not the project issue.)
  - **No ITSM link** → leave `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY` unset; `DETAILS_KEY` = `TARGET_KEY`. (Read details from the project issue itself.)

### How to determine `TARGET_PROJECT` (ITSM-originated only)

For project-originated issues the project is already known from the key prefix. For ITSM-originated issues, resolve the target project as follows:

1. **Existing link wins.** After fetching the ITSM issue, if it already links to an issue whose key prefix is `BAC-`, `WEB-`, or `FA-`, that is `TARGET_PROJECT` — no question needed.
2. **Fall back to cwd.** Otherwise, default to whichever repo the current working directory sits inside, and read **that** repo's `Jira project key` from its CLAUDE.md Workflow skills config — that is `TARGET_PROJECT`.
3. **Ask if ambiguous.** If neither rule resolves (e.g. cwd is outside all three repos, or the ITSM issue clearly describes a different layer than the cwd suggests), ask the user which project to target before doing anything else.

## Step 1 — Fetch issue details

Always read the bug report and context from `DETAILS_KEY` — i.e. the linked ITSM ticket when one exists, otherwise the project issue itself. When an ITSM ticket is linked, it is the source of truth for the reported symptoms, repro steps, and attachments; do **not** rely on the project issue for those details.

```bash
acli jira workitem view <DETAILS_KEY> --fields '*all'
```

Extract and note:
- **Summary / title**
- **Description and reported symptoms**
- **Affected component or service** (for ITSM-originated issues, often hints which `TARGET_PROJECT` is appropriate)
- **Priority and impact**
- **Reporter and any additional context**
- **Attachments** — note any attached files, especially HAR (`.har`) files, screenshots, or logs

### Review attachments (HAR files, screenshots, logs)

If `DETAILS_KEY` has attachments, **download and analyze them yourself using the
`review-jira-attachments` skill** — don't ask the reporter to describe them. HAR files capture the full
browser network activity at the time of the bug and often reveal the exact request URLs, bodies, and
error responses that reproduce the problem; screenshots pin the affected screen/state.

`acli` cannot download attachments, so that skill uses the Jira REST API (needs `JIRA_API_TOKEN` +
`JIRA_EMAIL`, e.g. `set -a; . ~/.config/hoopit/jira.env; set +a`, with `$JIRA_BASE_URL` from CLAUDE.md).
Pass it `DETAILS_KEY`. Key reminder it enforces: HARs are 5–15 MB — never read one whole; extract just
the failing requests (status `0` or `>= 400`) and inspect those.

Focus on:
- **Failing requests** (non-2xx responses, or responses whose body contains error messages matching the reported symptom)
- **Request URL, method, headers, and body** — especially the payload shape and any serialization quirks
- **Response body** — the error message or unexpected data returned
- **Timing and sequence** — which request fired immediately before the failure

Use the findings to narrow down which endpoint, view, component, or screen is involved before starting the investigation.

If the issue cannot be understood or reproduced from the available information, stop and ask the user for clarification.

## Step 2 — Identify or create the target project issue

How this resolves depends on the scenario from *Determine the scenario*:

- **Project-originated** (input was a `BAC`/`WEB`/`FA` issue): `TARGET_KEY` is the input issue itself. **Do not create or link anything** — skip straight to **Step 3**. (Any linked ITSM ticket was already recorded as `ITSM_ISSUE_KEY`.)
- **ITSM-originated** (input was an `ITSM-…` ticket): follow 2a/2b below.

### 2a — Check for an existing linked target issue

**Do NOT use `acli jira workitem link list`** — it only returns `outwardIssueKey` and silently drops `inwardIssue` data. Target issues are typically linked as inward issues ("ITSM ticket is caused by BAC/WEB/FA bug"), so they will appear missing even when they exist.

Instead, fetch the `issuelinks` field directly and parse the JSON:

```bash
acli jira workitem view <ITSM_ISSUE_KEY> --fields 'issuelinks' --json
```

Inspect **both** `inwardIssue.key` and `outwardIssue.key` across all entries in the `fields.issuelinks` array. Look for any linked issue whose key starts with `BAC-`, `WEB-`, or `FA-`.

If such a link exists:
- Set `TARGET_PROJECT` from its prefix and `TARGET_KEY` to that key.
- Skip to **Step 3**.

### 2b — Create a new target issue if none exists

Resolve `TARGET_PROJECT` using the rules in *How to determine `TARGET_PROJECT`* above. Then map the ITSM request type to the destination issue type. The mapping is the same across all three projects:

| ITSM request type | Issue type in `TARGET_PROJECT` |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Problem           | **Bug**                        |
| Feature request   | **Story**                      |
| Anything else     | **Task**                       |

```bash
acli jira workitem create \
  --project "$TARGET_PROJECT" \
  --type '<Bug | Story | Task>' \
  --summary '<concise title>' \
  --description '## Summary
<1-2 sentence description>

## Root cause / background
<technical explanation or context>

## References
- ITSM: [<ITSM_ISSUE_KEY>]($JIRA_BASE_URL/browse/<ITSM_ISSUE_KEY>)'
```

Note the new `TARGET_KEY` printed by the command (e.g. `BAC-6934`, `WEB-1234`, `FA-987`).

Create an **"is caused by"** link from the ITSM ticket to the new issue (i.e. the ITSM issue *is caused by* the target bug).

If unsure of the exact link-type name, list available types first:

```bash
acli jira workitem link type
```

Then create the link:

```bash
acli jira workitem link create \
  --out '<ITSM_ISSUE_KEY>' \
  --in '<TARGET_KEY>' \
  --type 'Causes' \
  --yes
```

> **Note:** The direction matters — `--out` is the outward issue (the effect: ITSM ticket) and `--in` is the inward issue (the cause: target bug). Verify direction with `acli jira workitem link type` if needed.

`TARGET_KEY` is the `JIRA_KEY` used for all subsequent steps.

## Step 3 — Create a Git branch as a worktree

All branch/worktree work happens inside `TARGET_REPO`. From here on, treat `TARGET_REPO` as the working repo — `cd` into it if you aren't already there.

Branch naming convention (same across all three repos): `<JIRA_KEY>/bug/<short-kebab-description>`

Examples:
- `BAC-6934/bug/dintero-payment-data-double-serialized`
- `WEB-1234/bug/club-admin-roster-export-empty`
- `FA-987/bug/login-screen-crash-on-empty-input`

### Defer to the target repo's `create-worktree` skill

Each repo owns its own worktree/venv/test-DB conventions, so **do not** hand-roll the worktree setup here. Instead:

1. Look for `TARGET_REPO/.claude/skills/create-worktree/SKILL.md`.
2. If it exists, read it and follow its instructions to create the branch and worktree. That skill is responsible for things like virtualenv wiring, isolated test DBs, or any other per-repo setup the worktree needs.
3. If it does **not** exist, fall back to a plain worktree:

   ```bash
   cd "$TARGET_REPO"
   git fetch origin
   BRANCH="<JIRA_KEY>/bug/<short-description>"
   WORKTREE_DIR=".worktrees/$(echo $BRANCH | tr '/' '-')"
   git worktree add -b "$BRANCH" "$WORKTREE_DIR" origin/master
   ```

   (Adjust `origin/master` if the repo's default branch is different — check with `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`.)

All subsequent steps (4–9) run from `$WORKTREE_DIR` unless stated otherwise.

## Step 4 — Implement the fix

- Navigate to the relevant file(s) in `$WORKTREE_DIR` identified from the issue description and investigation.
- Apply the minimal, targeted fix.
- Follow existing code conventions. Read any relevant skill files in `$TARGET_REPO/.claude/skills/` that apply to the area you're touching (for example, the api repo has `models`, `views`, `urls`, `migrations` skills; the web-admin repo and flutter-app may have their own). Skip skills that don't exist.
- Do **not** refactor unrelated code.

## Step 5 — Write tests

Defer to the target repo's testing conventions:

1. If `TARGET_REPO/.claude/skills/writing-tests/SKILL.md` exists, read and follow it before writing tests.
2. If `TARGET_REPO/.claude/skills/running-tests/SKILL.md` exists, use its instructions to run tests.

Goal regardless of stack:
- Add at least **1 test** that reproduces the bug and verifies the fix.
- Place the test next to the code being fixed, following the surrounding test layout.
- Include a comment/docstring referencing the Jira issue, e.g.:

```python
def test_payment_data_not_double_serialized(self):
    """
    Regression test for BAC-6934.
    payment_data must be passed as a dict, not a JSON string,
    when calling the Dintero Google Pay endpoint.
    """
```

Run the new test (and any related tests) to confirm they pass. If the repo provides no realistic way to add an automated regression test for this kind of bug (e.g. some flutter-app UI bugs), say so explicitly in the PR description instead of skipping silently.

If tests fail, fix the issues before proceeding.

## Step 6 — Commit changes

Stage and commit all changes from within the worktree. Include the `Refs <ITSM_ISSUE_KEY>` footer **only when an ITSM ticket is linked** — omit it entirely for a project issue with no ITSM link:

```bash
cd "$WORKTREE_DIR"
git add -A
git commit -m "<JIRA_KEY>: <short description>

<Optional longer description of what was changed and why.>

Refs <ITSM_ISSUE_KEY>"
```

Example (ITSM linked):
```
BAC-6934: Fix double-serialization of payment_data in Dintero Google/Apple Pay

payment_data was being passed through json.dumps() before being added
to the request dict. Since _request() already uses json=data, this
resulted in Dintero receiving a JSON string instead of a JSON object.

Refs ITSM-1234
```

## Step 7 — Review gate (opus + CodeRabbit + Codex)

From inside the worktree, run the **`review-gate`** skill. It runs three independent reviewers — the
opus review always, plus CodeRabbit and Codex when installed locally — against `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`,
aggregates + de-dups their findings, fixes the valid ones (committing each per its own convention),
tracks the skipped ones, and returns a verdict:

- **`PASS`** → keep the gate's notes block (which reviewers ran, findings fixed, findings
  skipped-with-reason) for the PR body, and continue to **Step 8**.
- **`BLOCK: <reason>`** → there is a *disputed* Critical/High finding (or a valid one that isn't safe
  to fix in this change). **Do not push and do not open a PR.** Surface the blocking findings. When
  running unattended (e.g. via `auto-fix-next-bug`), take the escape hatch instead: add a Jira comment
  on the issue with the blocking findings, transition it to **Escalated**, and stop — never open a
  low-confidence PR.

The gate owns the fix-commit convention and the skipped-findings list, so they live there, not here.

## Step 8 — Push the branch

Push normally — including from a worktree, where the pre-push hooks resolve
the main repo's virtualenv on their own:

```bash
cd "$WORKTREE_DIR"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

## Step 9 — Create a Pull Request

Create a PR using the GitHub CLI. Include the `## ITSM` section **only when an ITSM ticket is linked** — omit it for a project issue with no ITSM link.

**Required PR labels.** If you were invoked by an orchestrator (or instructed) to put specific labels on the PR, create it *with* them rather than adding them afterward — append `--label <name>` to this command for each required label (e.g. `--label ai --label preview`), so the PR is born labelled and never has an unlabelled window for `pull_request`-triggered automation to miss. Omit when no labels are required (the default for a human-driven run). The labels must already exist in the repo; if `gh pr create` rejects one, create the PR without it and backfill with `gh pr edit <pr> --add-label <name>`.

```bash
cd "$WORKTREE_DIR"
gh pr create \
  --title "<branch-name>" \
  --body "## Summary
<description of the fix>

## Jira
[<JIRA_KEY>]($JIRA_BASE_URL/browse/<JIRA_KEY>)

## ITSM
[<ITSM_ISSUE_KEY>]($JIRA_BASE_URL/browse/<ITSM_ISSUE_KEY>)

## Changes
- <bullet point summary of changes>

## Testing
- <describe the test(s) added, or state explicitly that no automated regression test was feasible and why>

## Code review (review-gate)
Reviewers run: <opus, CodeRabbit, Codex — note any skipped as unavailable/error>

### Findings addressed
- <reviewer> · <severity>: <finding> — <what was done>

### Findings not addressed
- <reviewer> · <severity>: <finding> — <reason for skipping>" \
  --base "$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
```

(Again, swap `master` for `main` if that's the repo's default branch.)

Report the PR URL to the user.
