# Hoopit skills installer.
#
# Installs the curated Hoopit skill set into your coding agent(s) using the
# Vercel `skills` CLI (https://skills.sh). It installs two things:
#
#   1. A curated subset of mattpocock/skills — pulled straight from his repo, so
#      `npx skills update` keeps them current automatically. His other skills are
#      intentionally NOT installed (no manual picker — the subset is fixed below).
#   2. Hoopit's own skills from hoopit/skills, organized into groups (see below).
#
# Re-run any time; it is safe to repeat. To update later: `npx skills update`.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install.sh                                        # all groups, Claude Code, global
#   SKILL_GROUPS="onboarding" ./install.sh              # only the onboarding group
#   SKILL_GROUPS="onboarding,dev" ./install.sh      # several groups
#   EXCLUDE_GROUPS="misc" ./install.sh                  # everything except misc
#   AGENTS="claude-code,universal" ./install.sh    # also the generic ~/.config/agents/skills
#   AGENTS="" ./install.sh                          # pick agents interactively (TTY only)
#   SCOPE=-p ./install.sh                           # project-local instead of global
#   gh api repos/hoopit/skills/contents/install.sh -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" | bash  # private repo: fetch with gh, not raw curl
#
set -euo pipefail

# Install scope: -g (global, user-level) by default; set SCOPE=-p for project.
SCOPE="${SCOPE:--g}"

# Agent target(s). Default: Claude Code + universal.
#   - We include `universal` so skills are symlinked rather than copied: the CLI
#     keeps one real copy in ~/.agents/skills and points ~/.claude/skills/<skill>
#     at it. With a single agent there's no shared store, so it writes copies.
#   - Override with a comma-separated list of agent keys, e.g.
#       AGENTS="claude-code"             (Claude Code only — copies, no symlinks)
#       AGENTS="claude-code,universal"   (valid keys: see `npx skills add <repo> -h`)
#   - Set AGENTS="" to choose interactively. NOTE: an interactive picker needs a
#     real terminal, so it does NOT work through the `curl | bash` one-liner —
#     use a pinned list (or run install.sh from a checkout) in that case.
# Using `${AGENTS-...}` (single dash) so an explicit empty value is kept as
# "interactive", while leaving it unset falls back to the default.
AGENTS="${AGENTS-claude-code,universal}"

# --- Hoopit skill groups -----------------------------------------------------
# The groups below mirror .claude-plugin/marketplace.json (which is what makes
# the groups show up in the `skills` interactive picker). Keep the two in sync.
# The `skills` CLI has no native --group / --exclude flags, so this installer
# expands groups into a `-s` skill list itself.
